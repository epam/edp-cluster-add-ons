# Task: Plan Story Implementation

## Description

Comprehensive technical planning task for developers to analyze, validate, and enhance story implementation details before beginning development work. This task ensures complete technical understanding, detailed task/subtask planning, and implementation readiness with source code structure, libraries, patterns, schemas, and technical specifications.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] **Story exists**: Target story file exists in `/docs/stories/` requiring implementation planning
- [ ] **Developer role**: Task executed by development team member with implementation responsibility
- [ ] **Story approved**: Story has been reviewed and approved for implementation
- [ ] **Technical context**: Access to architecture documentation, existing codebase, and technical standards

### Reference Assets

Dependencies:

- ./.krci-ai/templates/story.md
- ./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md

Validation: Verify all dependencies exist at specified paths before proceeding. HALT if any missing.

## Instructions

1. **Validate story completeness**: Ensure story has sufficient technical detail for implementation
2. **Analyze technical requirements**: Deep dive into implementation needs, dependencies, and constraints
3. **Plan implementation approach**: Define specific technical approach, libraries, patterns, and structure
4. **Enhance task/subtask sections**: Create detailed, executable implementation steps
5. **Validate technical understanding**: Ensure complete comprehension before implementation begins
6. **Document implementation plan**: Create comprehensive technical specifications and approach

## Output Format

- **Location**: Update existing story file with implementation planning enhancements
- **Template**: Maintain [story.md](./.krci-ai/templates/story.md) structure (8 sections only)
- **Content Placement**: Technical details in Description section, enhanced tasks in Tasks/Subtasks section
- **Implementation Ready**: Story contains specific file paths, commands, and technical specifications
- **Verification**: Story enables autonomous development without additional technical consultation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **Technical understanding complete**: Developer has full comprehension of implementation requirements
- [ ] **Implementation plan detailed**: All technical decisions documented and validated
- [ ] **Tasks/Subtasks enhanced**: Atomic, executable steps with complete specifications
- [ ] **Code structure planned**: Clear file structure, directories, and integration approach
- [ ] **Dependencies identified**: All libraries, tools, and external requirements specified
- [ ] **Validation strategy defined**: Complete testing approach with specific commands and criteria
- [ ] **Implementation ready**: Developer can begin work with confidence and clarity

## Execution Checklist

### Story Technical Validation

- [ ] **Story completeness check**: Verify story has business requirements and acceptance criteria
- [ ] **Technical gap analysis**: Identify missing technical details or specifications
- [ ] **Dependencies review**: Validate all technical dependencies are specified
- [ ] **Architecture alignment**: Confirm implementation approach fits project architecture

### Technical Requirements Analysis

- [ ] **Existing code analysis**: Review current codebase for integration points and patterns
- [ ] **Project structure mapping**: Analyze existing directory structure and identify where new components fit
- [ ] **Library specification**: Research and document required libraries with exact versions (format: `Library: package_name v1.2.3`)
- [ ] **Dependency compatibility**: Validate library compatibility with existing project dependencies
- [ ] **Pattern identification**: Define specific design patterns and approaches following project standards
- [ ] **Data structure planning**: Design schemas, models, and data flow with specific formats
- [ ] **Integration analysis**: Plan integration with existing systems and components
- [ ] **Configuration requirements**: Define environment setup, configuration files, and deployment needs
- [ ] **Performance considerations**: Identify performance requirements and optimization needs

### Implementation Approach Planning

- [ ] **Directory organization**: Plan specific directory structure following project patterns (src/, tests/, docs/, config/)
- [ ] **File structure design**: Define exact file paths and names for creation/modification (`/src/component/file.ext`)
- [ ] **Integration point mapping**: Identify specific integration points with existing codebase and APIs
- [ ] **Component architecture**: Define classes, functions, and component responsibilities with interfaces
- [ ] **Code reuse identification**: Identify opportunities to reuse existing components and shared utilities
- [ ] **Data flow design**: Map input/output flow and transformation logic with specific data formats
- [ ] **Error handling strategy**: Plan exception handling and error recovery following project patterns
- [ ] **Testing approach**: Define unit, integration, and validation testing strategy with existing frameworks
- [ ] **Security considerations**: Identify security requirements and implementation approach per project standards

### Task/Subtask Enhancement

- [ ] **Enhanced task formatting**: Use format "**Task N: Description (AC: X, Y)**" with clear acceptance criteria mapping
- [ ] **Atomic task breakdown**: Create single-responsibility implementation tasks with specific deliverables
- [ ] **Specific file targets**: Define exact file paths for creation/modification (`create file: /path/to/file.ext`)
- [ ] **Command specifications**: Include executable commands for each step (`run: command with args`)
- [ ] **Validation command integration**: Add verification commands for each task (`Command: \`test_command\``)
- [ ] **Purpose specification**: Document the purpose and responsibility of each file/component created
- [ ] **Dependency mapping**: Define dependencies between tasks using "depends on Task X completion" format
- [ ] **Success criteria**: Specify measurable completion criteria (file exists, tests pass, output matches)
- [ ] **Error recovery planning**: Define rollback steps if subtasks fail during implementation

### Technical Specifications Documentation

- [ ] **Libraries and versions**: Document all dependencies with specific versions
- [ ] **Configuration details**: Specify environment setup and configuration requirements
- [ ] **Database schemas**: Define data models, tables, and relationships if applicable
- [ ] **API specifications**: Document interfaces, endpoints, and data contracts
- [ ] **File formats**: Specify input/output formats, validation rules, and constraints
- [ ] **Command patterns**: Document CLI commands, scripts, and automation tools

### Implementation Validation Planning

- [ ] **Unit testing plan**: Define specific unit tests for each component
- [ ] **Integration testing**: Plan testing of component interactions and data flow
- [ ] **Validation commands**: Create specific commands to verify implementation correctness
- [ ] **Performance testing**: Define performance benchmarks and testing approach
- [ ] **Security validation**: Plan security testing and vulnerability assessment
- [ ] **End-to-end verification**: Create complete workflow validation steps

### Quality Assurance Integration

- [ ] **Code review preparation**: Identify areas requiring review and validation
- [ ] **Documentation requirements**: Plan code documentation and technical specifications
- [ ] **Compliance verification**: Ensure implementation meets project standards
- [ ] **Rollback planning**: Define rollback procedures if implementation fails
- [ ] **Monitoring setup**: Plan logging, monitoring, and observability integration
- [ ] **Deployment considerations**: Address deployment, configuration, and environment needs

## Content Guidelines

### Technical Planning Principles for LLM Self-Evaluation

- **Implementation-Ready Planning**: All technical decisions documented with specific details and rationale
- **Executable Task Enhancement**: Every task/subtask enhanced to be executable without additional research
- **Comprehensive Technical Validation**: Complete testing and verification approach planned for implementation
- **Architecture Integration**: All integration points, dependencies, and technical standards identified

### LLM Error Prevention Checklist

- **Avoid**: Generic planning without specific technical details (libraries, versions, file paths)
- **Avoid**: Task enhancement without validation commands and success criteria
- **Avoid**: Implementation planning that ignores existing project structure and patterns
- **Reference**: Use [story.md](./.krci-ai/templates/story.md) template for consistent enhancement formatting
