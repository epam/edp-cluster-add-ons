# Task: Review Story (Developer)

## Description

Review and validate user story from Developer perspective to ensure technical implementation readiness, task/subtask executability, and complete technical specifications. Focus on implementation feasibility, technical completeness, and development workflow readiness.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] **Story exists**: Target story file exists in `/docs/stories/` requiring developer technical review
- [ ] **Technical context**: Understanding of existing codebase, architecture, and technical standards
- [ ] **Implementation authority**: Developer expertise to validate technical feasibility and approach
- [ ] **Development environment**: Access to existing codebase and technical documentation

### Reference Assets

Dependencies:

- ./.krci-ai/templates/story.md
- ./.krci-ai/data/common/sdlc-framework.md

Validation: Verify all dependencies exist at specified paths before proceeding. HALT if any missing.

## Instructions

1. **Validate technical completeness**: Ensure story has sufficient detail for autonomous implementation
2. **Review task/subtask specificity**: Verify implementation steps are atomic, executable, and well-defined
3. **Check technical specifications**: Validate libraries, file paths, verification methods/commands, and dependencies are complete
4. **Assess implementation feasibility**: Confirm technical approach is viable and follows project standards
5. **Verify validation completeness**: Ensure testing and verification steps are comprehensive and executable

## Output Format

- **Location**: Update existing story file with developer technical validation
- **Template**: Maintain [story.md](./.krci-ai/templates/story.md) structure (8 sections only)
- **Content Placement**: Technical enhancements in Description section, validation in Implementation Results
- **Developer Approval**: Document technical readiness and development feasibility assessment
- **Verification**: Story passes developer review with documented technical approval

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **Technical implementation details complete**: All libraries, versions, file paths, and commands specified
- [ ] **Tasks/subtasks executable**: Each implementation step is atomic, specific, and actionable
- [ ] **Implementation autonomous**: Developer can implement without external technical consultations
- [ ] **Testing strategy comprehensive**: Validation commands and success criteria clearly defined
- [ ] **Architecture compliance**: Implementation approach follows project patterns and standards
- [ ] **Developer approval documented**: Technical readiness validation and approval recorded

## Execution Checklist

### Technical Completeness Assessment

- [ ] **Library specifications**: All required libraries include specific versions (e.g., `gopkg.in/yaml.v3 v3.0.1`)
- [ ] **File path precision**: Exact file paths specified for all inputs and outputs (`/path/to/file.ext`)
- [ ] **Verification executability**: Verification methods/commands are specific and executable without modification
- [ ] **Dependency clarity**: Technical dependencies clearly specified and available

### Task/Subtask Implementation Review

- [ ] **Atomic verification**: Each subtask represents single, executable action
- [ ] **Verification completeness**: Every subtask includes specific verification method/steps and success indicators
- [ ] **File target specificity**: Each task specifies exact files to create, modify, or validate
- [ ] **Validation integration**: Each subtask includes verification commands and success indicators

### Technical Architecture Validation

- [ ] **Project structure alignment**: Implementation fits existing directory and module organization
- [ ] **Pattern consistency**: Code follows established project patterns and conventions
- [ ] **Integration point clarity**: Clear identification of how new code integrates with existing systems
- [ ] **Performance consideration**: Implementation approach addresses performance requirements

### Implementation Feasibility Check

- [ ] **Technical viability**: Proposed approach is technically sound and implementable
- [ ] **Resource availability**: Required tools, libraries, and dependencies are accessible
- [ ] **Complexity assessment**: Implementation complexity matches story points and timeline
- [ ] **Risk identification**: Technical risks identified with mitigation approaches

### Quality Assurance Validation

- [ ] **Testing completeness**: QA checklist includes comprehensive testing requirements
- [ ] **Verification method**: Clear verification method provided (automated | semi-automated | manual) with commands where applicable
- [ ] **Success criteria**: Clear, measurable criteria for implementation completion
- [ ] **Error handling**: Testing includes error scenarios and edge cases

### Development Workflow Readiness

- [ ] **Implementation sequence**: Clear order of implementation tasks and dependencies
- [ ] **Development environment**: Environment setup and configuration requirements specified
- [ ] **Code review preparation**: Implementation approach enables effective code review
- [ ] **Documentation requirements**: Technical documentation needs clearly defined

## Content Guidelines

### Technical Implementation Principles for LLM Self-Evaluation

- **Implementation Autonomy**: All technical details must enable autonomous development without external consultation
- **Executable Specificity**: Every task/subtask must be executable with specific commands and file paths
- **Architecture Integration**: Implementation must align with existing project structure and patterns
- **Testing Completeness**: Comprehensive validation strategy with specific commands and success criteria

### LLM Error Prevention Checklist

- **Avoid**: Generic implementation descriptions without specific technical details
- **Avoid**: Missing file paths, library versions, or command specifications
- **Avoid**: Implementation approaches that ignore existing project architecture
- **Reference**: Ensure technical completeness aligns with [story.md](./.krci-ai/templates/story.md) template requirements
