# Update Existing EDP Cluster Add-on

I'll help you update an existing add-on in the EDP Cluster Add-ons repository following all best practices.

First, I need some information about the update you want to make:

1. Which add-on do you want to update?
2. What changes do you want to make? (version upgrade, configuration changes, etc.)
3. Why are these changes necessary?

Based on your answers, I'll help you:

1. Navigate to the correct location in `clusters/core/addons/`
2. Update the appropriate files (Chart.yaml, values.yaml, etc.)
3. If upgrading a dependency chart, update dependencies correctly
4. Ensure proper version increments in Chart.yaml
5. Update any relevant documentation
6. Provide testing commands to validate your changes

I'll follow all repository best practices and ensure your changes maintain the GitOps approach used in this repository.

Let's get started!
