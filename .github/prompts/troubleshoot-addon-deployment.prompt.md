# Troubleshoot Add-on Deployment Issues

I'll help you troubleshoot issues with add-on deployments in the EDP Cluster Add-ons repository. Let's systematically identify and resolve the problem.

First, I need some information about the issue:

1. Which add-on is experiencing deployment problems?
2. What are the symptoms or error messages you're seeing?
3. Have you made recent changes to the add-on configuration?
4. Is this a new add-on or one that was previously working?

Based on your answers, I'll help you:

1. Validate the chart structure and syntax
2. Check for common configuration issues
3. Verify dependency versions and repositories
4. Examine Argo CD logs and status information
5. Test the chart locally using Helm commands
6. Provide specific fixes for identified issues

Common issues I'll check for include:
- Incorrect dependency references in Chart.yaml
- Values structure not matching chart expectations
- Missing or incorrect namespace configuration
- Helm chart version compatibility problems
- Resource constraints or conflicts
- Permissions or RBAC issues

Let's start troubleshooting your add-on deployment issue!
